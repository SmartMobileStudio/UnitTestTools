This repository contains the open sourced code of the Smart Mobile Studio command-line compiler unit test that is used to ensure a high quality of the compiler.

While internally we use a different tool, which integrates even further into the toolchain, this tool can be use to create unit tests by adding different scripts and the expected output to the 'Tests' directory. These tests can then be used in our tool chain to locate the issue within no time.

This tool can also be used for custom projects to ensure that it compiles and runs reliable.
